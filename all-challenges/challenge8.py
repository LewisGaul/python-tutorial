# WEEK 8 CHALLENGE

# Pick one of the following and see if you can do it from scratch:
#   Create a GUI game, e.g. buttons which light up in different colours for
#   short periods of time, with the aim being to click buttons that flash
#   green but not when they flash red (or something like that...).

#   First Google 'persistence of a number'. Create a dictionary with the
#   persistance as the key, and a list of numbers with that persistance as
#   the corresponding value. Once you have done this I can show you how to plot
#   graphs in Python.
