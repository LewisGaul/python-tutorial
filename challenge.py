# WEEK 2 CHALLENGE

# Notice you can write single-line comments with the '#' symbol.
# This text will not be executed by the interpreter.

# Blank lines can be used wherever you like to make your code easier to read.
# Try not to let your lines of code exceed 80 characters in length.

# Work out how the code works, add in some comments and make some improvements
# by using better variable names and clearer code where you can.
